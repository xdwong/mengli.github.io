title: "Structural flexibility indices with shrinking capacities in cross production"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/IJPR2012
excerpt: 'This paper examines structure indices for process flexibility planning with efficiency loss in cross production. We generalise the Structural Flexibility Index and the Graph Expander Index by incorporating shrinking capacity factors. These two deterministic indices are computationally tractable and they allow for simple analysis of alternative system designs. Therefore, they can help design an effective flexibility structure without extensive simulations. Numerical experiments show that both indices can predict the flexibility performance of various system structures.'
