<b>Abstract: </b><i>This study investigates the impacts of transshipment between overconfident newsvendors who perceive the expected outcome of a random event as more certain than it actually is. The conventional wisdom is that transshipment is a risk-pooling strategy for improving newsvendorsâ€™ performance. However, we find that overconfident newsvendors can be worse off with transshipment as compared to without transshipment. This result remains when overconfident newsvendors possess other behaviors such as fairness, demand- and supply-side thinking, loss aversion, and demand anchoring. We also utilize data from controlled experiments to demonstrate that overconfidence is a robust behavior with transshipment.
